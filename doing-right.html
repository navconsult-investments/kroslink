      <p>
        KrosLinkFinanceOnlineBanking has invested $30 million into scholarship grants, literacy campaigns, and teacher
        training programs to support underfunded educational sectors in both urban and rural communities. Our focus has been
        on reducing barriers to learning by covering school fees, providing materials, and promoting inclusive access.

      <p>
        Beyond direct student support, our $110 million initiative funds the construction of new classrooms, digital learning
        centers, and teacher infrastructure upgrades. We believe long-term national development is powered by
        sustainable, equitable education and this fund is designed to build just that.
